# **App Name**: CalReact

## Core Features:

- Calendar View: Display events in day, week and month views, inspired by Bryntum Calendar, using fully type-safe React components.
- Event Modal: Allow users to create, edit, and delete events in a modal.
- Drag and Drop Events: Allow users to drag and drop and resize events in the calendar view.
- Event Filtering: Users can filter events by a search term.
- Smart Title Enrichment: If the user adds a generic title to an event, such as "Meeting", the LLM can act as a tool to elaborate, automatically enriching the title, such as renaming it to "Project Kickoff Meeting with Stakeholders".

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calming blue (#64B5F6) to evoke a sense of productivity and focus.
- Background color: A very light blue (#F0F8FF), almost white, for a clean and spacious feel.
- Accent color: A vibrant purple (#BA68C8) to highlight key interactive elements, providing a touch of creativity.
- Clean, sans-serif font (following existing project) for clear readability of event details and calendar navigation.
- Simple, outlined icons for event categories and navigation controls, ensuring clarity without visual clutter.
- Spacious layout with ample white space to prevent a crowded feel, enhancing the usability of the calendar.
- Subtle transitions and animations for event creation, deletion, and view changes to provide a smooth user experience.
